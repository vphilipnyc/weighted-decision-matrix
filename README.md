# Weighted Decision-Making

[![Build Status][github-actions-status]][github-actions-url]

Using weighted decision-making is simple and straightforward. 

First, you'll identify all the factors that are important to you when making a decision. 
This could include things like cost, convenience, potential outcomes, and personal values. 

Next, you'll assign a weight to each factor based on how important it is to you. 

Finally, you'll calculate the overall score for each option by multiplying the weight of each factor by the option's score on that factor. 
The option with the highest overall score is the one that best aligns with your priorities and values.

There are numerous benefits to using weighted decision-making. 
By considering all the factors that are important to you and assigning them weights, 
you can make more objective and unbiased decisions. You'll also be able to consider a wide range of factors, 
rather than just a few key points, which can lead to more informed and confident decisions. 
And because you'll be basing your decisions on a clear set of priorities and values, you can feel more assured that 
your decisions are truly aligned with what matters most to you.

Weighted decision-making can be applied to a wide variety of decisions, both big and small. 
Here are a few examples of the types of decisions that you can make using this method:
* Choosing a new job: Consider factors like salary, benefits, commute, company culture, and potential for growth
* Deciding on a vacation destination: Consider factors like cost, weather, activities, safety, and cultural attractions
* Selecting a new car: Consider factors like cost, fuel efficiency, safety ratings, features, and style

Happy decision-making!
